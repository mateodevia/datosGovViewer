# datosGovViewer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objective

This is a project that allows the  user to view datasets taken from https://datos.gov.co

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd frontend`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `frontend/build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>


The backend is already configured to serve this buil folder.
