## Message for the Teacher
This is a message exclusively to my web development teacher.

Hello John, I am sending this around 7:00pm on tuesday. Therefore, I am applying to the second deliverable version (exam+bonus+deployment). My creative component is the pages. When the user requests the dataset normally (just the first 1000 registers), I added extra buttons to navigate through the dataset. The "siguiente" and "anterior" buttons allow the user to query the next 1000 registers or the previous 1000 registers.
